WORD FREQUENCY COUNTER
Knowing how often a word appears in a sentence or block of text is helpful for
several types of word analysis.

Using your preferred language/framework, create your own algorithm that reads
a text file and counts the frequency of words in the given text. Then it
counts words and characters, and also constructs a histogram displaying the
words and the frequency.

Example Output.
Given a file with the text below
lumu lumu lumu lumu lumu illuminates illuminates attacks and adversaries
lumu illuminates all attacks and adversaries

Your algorithm should print the following output:

16 words
116 characters
lumu: 6
illuminates: 3
attacks: 2
adversaries: 2
and: 1
all: 1

Requirements:
● Ensure that the output arranges the words by their number of occurrences
in descendent order.
● Explain what is the computational complexity of your algorithm.
